//! # Game Detection & Configuration
//!
//! Detects running games and provides game-specific tunnel configuration:
//! - Port ranges for packet capture
//! - Known server IP ranges
//! - Anti-cheat considerations
//! - Game-specific packet handling
//!
//! ## Auto-Detection
//!
//! `auto_detect()` scans running processes and matches them against known
//! game process names. Supports:
//! - **Fortnite**: `FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping.exe`
//! - **CS2**: `cs2.exe`
//! - **Dota 2**: `dota2.exe`
//! - **Rust** (Facepunch): `RustClient.exe`
//! - **Valorant**: `VALORANT-Win64-Shipping.exe`
//! - **Apex Legends**: `r5apex.exe`
//! - **Overwatch 2**: `Overwatch.exe`
//! - **League of Legends**: `League of Legends.exe`
//! - **PUBG: Battlegrounds**: `TslGame.exe`
//! - **MapleStory**: `MapleStory.exe`
//! - **Genshin Impact**: `GenshinImpact.exe`
//! - **Rocket League**: `RocketLeague.exe`
//! - **World of Tanks**: `WorldOfTanks.exe`
//! - **Roblox**: `RobloxPlayerBeta.exe`
//! - **WARDOGS**: `WardogsClient-Win64-Shipping.exe`
//! - **Minecraft**: `Minecraft.Windows.exe` (Bedrock Edition)
//! - **Minecraft Java Edition**: `javaw.exe`/`java.exe` whose command line
//!   carries `net.minecraft.client.main.Main` (the image name alone is shared
//!   by every Java application, so it is never trusted on its own)
//! - **Hunt: Showdown**: `HuntGame.exe`
//!
//! ## Capture Filters
//!
//! Each game provides a `CaptureFilter` via `build_capture_filter()` that
//! generates an appropriate BPF filter for pcap capture mode: UDP games emit
//! the `udp port`/`udp portrange` grammar, while a game that declares
//! `tcp_ports()` emits the `tcp` equivalent.
